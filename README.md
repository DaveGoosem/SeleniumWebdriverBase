#Selenium Webdriver Base Project

This is a neat base package which can be used to start new Selenium Webdriver projects. It's written in C# and the tests should be executed in Nunit.

It includes a set of example tests created for another of my projects [Creative-404.com](http://creative-404.com).

The example tests should contain a heap of comments explaining what is going on.

Will add to this whenever I find something useful or a new/better way of tackling something.
